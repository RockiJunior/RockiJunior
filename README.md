    <p style="font-size: 20px">My full name is Gabriel SebastiÃ¡n Villarroel. I am a semi-senior Fullstack Web Developer with approximately 3 and a half years of experience. My first year of my education and experience as a programmer was of self-taught education and then continued with 3 years of professional experience. During the initial months of my self-directed learning, I engaged in Udemy courses and practiced algorithms with TypeScript for about six months. Subsequently, I enrolled in the Soy Henry Bootcamp for 4-5 months, where I worked on both individual and group projects, developing Single Page Applications (SPAs).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Following this challenge, I worked as a backend developer for 6-7 months at Econocom-Gigigo (MX). This experience honed my ability to manage logic and solve advanced programming problems. Throughout that period, I had to acquire proficiency in multiple technologies, which fostered a great deal of autonomy within me. (I can tackle almost any task independently with just a bit of context regarding the requirements).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Afterward, I spent 6-7 months on a real estate project through an agreement with the Technical University of Buenos Aires, where I served as a backend developer, providing support in both client-side and administrative user (CMS) areas.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I then shifted my focus towards fullstack development and worked as a Semi-Senior Fullstack Developer at Latech LLC for 9-10 months. During this time, I conducted web layout based on designs and implemented numerous logical and large-scale resolutions for various company projects. I utilized integrations from different Node libraries and frameworks from specialized e-commerce companies like Outsmartly.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Actually, i am working as a Fullstack Developer at Terratio since april 2024, a leading company offering an innovative platform to enhance sustainability in food production, particularly in tropical dry forests.
    From a young age, I've been passionate about acquiring new knowledge and solving problems, which is why I believe I can excel in any type of work environment.
